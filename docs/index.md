Our group is composed of researchers from The University of Exeter, The University of Waterloo, and The University of Guelph.

We are developing a method to detect early warning signals of tipping points in the climate system using deep learning algorithms. This will improve on existing statistical approaches for tipping point detection with an increased capability to identify impending tipping points and what form they may take.
