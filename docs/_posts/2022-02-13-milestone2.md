## Develop framework for the hybrid models identifying the known and unknown parts along with mathematical approaches.
In the first milestone report we identified the components of our deep learning model for the prediction of tipping points in the climate system. We also identified appropriate training datasets to train the CNN. Much of this work was to facilitate the inclusion of spatially explicit datasets to expand our ability to detect EWS beyond temporal datasets and exploit the additional information provided by the two additional dimensions in spatial data.

## Develop framework for the hybrid model
We have developed a framework to expand the CNN to work with spatial data. While bifurcations can occur on low-dimensional manifolds in climate systems, this is not the only mechanism by which abrupt transitions might take place. Higher-dimensional, spatially organized systems admit discontinuous shifts of equilibrium which are described by the theoretical framework of phase transitions. These phenomena bear some relationship to dynamical bifurcations (in some cases mean-field approximations provide a reduced form for a system undergoing a phase transition which is equivalent to the normal form for a known bifurcation), but can be more varied in their manifestation and produce different early-warning signals leading up to a transition. This added diversity will require a more sophisticated model to successfully classify time series data, but may offer a tool which is much more generalizable and robust to false positives than the simpler ODE bifurcation model. Recent theoretical work supports the hypothesis that early warning-signal detection in the phase transition framework may present the opportunity to leverage more modern, data-intensive computational techniques to improve performance, which is our goal with this neural model.

We have already constructed a working prototype for this approach, which works as follows: First, we generate a training set of time series data for phase transitions on a 2D lattice. Data is generated for transitions, in which the order parameter passes through its critical threshold and the system undergoes an abrupt global change, and null runs, in which the order parameter is held away from the critical regime. Our training data is currently made up of results from the 2D square Ising model, simulated undergoing either a first-order phase transition due to a changing external magnetic field, or a second-order phase transition due to changing temperature. For each run, we apply randomized coarse-graining in space and time to smooth out the distribution of lattice site values (which are discrete and binary in the Ising model), and then randomly subsample 9x9 grids from the resulting spatiotemporal data. We perform a further reduction of dimensionality by computing classical early-warning signal statistics (specifically, scalar time series for variance, skewness, kurtosis, and lag-1, -2, and -3 autocorrelation along the space and time axes). This approach was chosen as a relatively straightforward method for reducing the input dimension of the neural network (from 81 to 12) while preserving the components which are theoretically predicted to contain the most early-warning signal information content. A more flexible approach, which we hope to explore soon, would be to train directly on the spatial grid data and include an additional encoder module in the neural network consisting of one or more layers to produce a dimensionally-reduced representation for the input.

Results from our prototype model have been promising. Tested on a withheld portion of the training set, the CNN-LSTM correctly classifies more than 99% of runs, even when it is supplied with time series data truncated well before the observed transition. We have also tested it on simulated data from non-Ising systems undergoing phase transitions: a coupled vegetation-water system which undergoes an aridification transition as rainfall decreases, and a simple sea ice model which exhibits a percolation phase transition in saltwater content as its porosity increases. ROC curves for the model’s true- vs. false-positive classification rates at varied discrimination thresholds are plotted below. For both systems, the model trained exclusively on Ising model data transfers quite well to the new test case (area under ROC curve ≥ 90%). Results are presented for models trained on only spatial or only temporal EWS statistics (green, orange) as well as those trained on all statistics together (blue). Interestingly, classification of the sea ice percolation transitions is more successful when the temporal information is omitted entirely. We suspect that while theory suggests that EWS information should be present in all of these coordinates, the specific dynamical properties and characteristic time- and length-scales of a given system may render one set of statistics more useful than another.
