This folder contains the code to analyse Arcitc sea ice transitions and to plot the results. The scripts included are:

Analyse_data - calculate first month that Summer sea ice concentration dips below a defined threshold. Calculate early warning signals for each pixel prio to this transition. Use Bury DL Model to calculate probability of a tipping point in each pixel.

Plotting_ice_results - plot results from data analyses on polar coordinate grid using ggplot. 

Sea ice concentration data can be downloaded from: https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051/versions/2
